     This lake runs from India to China. More than 60% of the lake lies in China. During the peak winter, this lake freezes and thus, it is best
      to visit the lake between May and September. The banks of this lake are clich√© camping spots in the state. You can spot many migration birds
     too. The lake changes its color throughout the day, based on the position of sun on the sky.

    Known as the vanishing beach, the Chandipur Beach is also one of the most unique and unusual beaches in India. Also known as the 
    magical hide and seek beach, it vanishes away during every ebb tide, i.e. the time period between a high tide and a low tide. This 
    phenomenon happens twice a day when the beach when the beach totally disappears underwater as if there was no land at that 
    place previously.</p>
