         The Somnath temple (also known as the Deo Patan) located in Veraval in Saurashtra on the western coast of Gujarat,
         India is believed to be the first among the twelve Jyotirlinga shrines of Shiva.It is an important pilgrimage and 
         tourist spot of Gujarat. Reconstructed several times in the past after repeated destruction by several Muslim invaders and rulers,
         the present mandir was reconstructed in the Chaulukya style of Hindu temple architecture and completed in May 1951.The temple is
         considered sacred due to the various legends connected to it. Somnath means "Lord of the Soma", an epithet of Lord Shiva.
         According to tradition, the Shivalinga in Somnath is one of the 12 jyotirlingas in India, where Shiva is believed to have appeared
         as a fiery column of light. The jyotirlingas are taken as the supreme, undivided reality out of which Shiva partly appears.</p>

                    The Rann of Kutch  is a large area of salt marshes that span the border between India and Pakistan. 
                    It is located mostly in Gujarat (primarily the Kutch district), India, and in some parts of Sindh, Pakistan. It is divided
                    into the Great Rann and Little Rann.  The nothingness for miles is both nerve wracking and stunning with small oasis of water bodies and 
                    shrub forests doubling up as homes for pink flamingoes and wild asses. Tribal hamlets with cylindrical mud bhungas (huts) are
                    the epicenter for Kutchi embroidery, tie and dye, leatherwork, pottery, bell metal craft and the famous Rogan painting by the
                     only surviving expert family. Approximately 200 km east of the Rann, is the Little Rann of Kutch, which houses the 4953-sq-km 
                     Wild Ass Sanctuary. It homes the only remaining population of the chestnut-coloured Indian wild ass (khur), as well as 
                     blue-bulls, blackbuck and chinkara. </p>
