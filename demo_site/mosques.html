     The largest mosque in India capable to accommodate around 25,000 devotees during prayer, Delhi Jama Masjid ranks among the worlds’ most
      popular Muslim religious sites. An inseparable part of Delhi tourism, this architectural extravaganza was constructed by Mughal emperor 
      Shah Jahan in 1644. Brought out with impressive detailing over the minarets, domes, arches and doors, this highly decorative masjid 
      comprises four grand towers, three huge gates. The minarets are 40m high and made of red sandstone and white marbles. The mosque is about
       261 feet (80 m) long and 90 feet (27 m) wide. To make resemblance with the Jama Masjid of Agra, the floor of this mosque had been covered
        with white and black ornamented marbles (making it look like a Muslim prayer mat). The inlay detailing in the interior arches looks 
        impressive till date. The northern gate of Delhi Jama Masjid has 39 steps and the southern side has 33 steps. The eastern gate to this 
        mosque was made for the rural entrance and it has 35 steps.

      and in 1198 he converted the building to a mosque with the extension of a seven-arched wall. This extended part was embellished with Islamic
       calligraphy in front of the pillared hall. On the front wall of the entrance one can see arches made of yellow limestone. The intriguing 
       rectangular panels carved on the walls of the prayer hall resemble the design of Persian mosques.</p><br>
