     Also known as the Golden City, Jaisalmer is a remarkable city right on the fringes of the Thar Desert. The dominating features of 
     Jaisalmer is the Jaisalmer Fort, or Sonar Qila, which is still an inhabited space. Unlike virtually every other fort in India, Jaisalmer 
     is completely functioning, and within the fort you’ll find private residences, shops and even restaurants. Souvenir shopping within the
     fort is a fun experience, with common souvenirs including bronze statues and silver jewelry. Within the fort’s walls, there are also a
     handful of temples. These Jain temples date back to the 12th century, and most are open to the public in the morning.

            Pushkar is a holy city, and it is known best for its Brahma temple and its annual camel fair. Brahma is one-third of the holy
             trinity in Hindu religion, and Pushkar is said to be the home of Brahma. The Brahma temple in Pushkar is impossible to miss, 
             especially because of the frequent chanting ceremonies that take place several times a day. Pushkar is also home to several other 
             temples devoted to Vishnu, Savitri and Shiva. Every November, Pushkar comes alive with a camel fair and Hindu pilgrimage.

                <img src="ranthambore.jpg" alt="Ranthambhore" style="float:right;width:25%;height:22vh;"> <h2>3. Ranthambhore</h2>
                This national park is also a wildlife sanctuary, and it is known as one of the top spots in the entire world to see tigers
                 in the wild. You can book a wildlife safari to explore the park and see the animals up close. A smaller, open-top vehicle 
                 called a gypsy is best for the braver visitors, and the larger open-top vehicles called canters offer a little more protection. 
                 In addition to the tigers, Ranthambhore National Park boasts wildlife that includes leopards, hyenas, sloth bears and so much
                  more. On a safari, you will also have the chance to see Ranthambhore Fort, which dates back to the 10th century.

                    Although the city of Bikaner is home to a palace, a historic fort and even a camel research center, many Indians know 
                    it as a destination for foodies with a sweet tooth. One of the local specialties you’ll definitely want to try is Kesar
                     Kulfi, a sweet and iced dessert that is delicious and refreshing on a hot afternoon. Desert safaris are also popular in 
                     Bikaner, and you can ride a camel into the desert to explore the local culture and landscape. It is impossible to miss
                      Bikaner’s Junagarh Fort, built in the 16th century and now holding an extensive museum about the region.</p>
